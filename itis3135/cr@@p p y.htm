    That I cannot say.
    
    I only know it was from this first visit to New Mexico.
    
    In August, 1970.
    
    Before I met my wife.
    
    Her mother, my ex - wife's grandmother, graciously offered to house me for a visit while I was in the South.
    
    My travel plans had been chang
    
    
    ed, and I arrived at her house on a hot August afternoon.
    
    My suitcase, the only thing I had, consisted of a few changes of clothing.

    <p>Do not go gentle into that good night
        Dylan Thomas - 1914-1953
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Do not go gentle into that good night,
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
        Because their words had forked no lightning they
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        
        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        And you, my father, there on the sad height,
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
